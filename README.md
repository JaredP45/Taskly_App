# Taskly_App
This projects is from a Django-REST course on Udemy.
With this course, I am learning about how to create a RESTful api website where administrators can moderate the users with permissions and users don't have permissions with others. The "house" app is an exercise that mimics the houses of Hogwarts, but nonetheless helps demonstrate the usefulness of DjangoREST.

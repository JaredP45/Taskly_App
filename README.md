# Taskly_App
This project is from a Django-REST course on Udemy.
With this course, I am learning about how to create a RESTful api website where administrators can moderate the users with permissions and where users don't have permissions with others in order to protect each user's information. The "house" app is an exercise that mimics the houses of Hogwarts in the Harry Potter series, but it nonetheless helps demonstrate the usefulness of DjangoREST.
